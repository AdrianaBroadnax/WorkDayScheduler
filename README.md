## Work Day Scheduler

# INDEX.HTML
The bootstrap was already added.
The jumbotron with the "Work Day Scheduler" was already added. 

I made the times to be col sm 2 from 8am-4pm
Then, for the user to put tasks into the scheduler, I made the coolumns small 6. 
Then I added a column where the user can save their plans or tasks that need to be completed.

From 8-12pm the user did not input anything for their schedule, so I made the time greyed out instead of the input field, with a "No task entered" placeholder. I thought it would look cleaner.
Then I added a column where the user can save their plans or tasks that need to be completed.

At 1pm that is the current time the user came into the work day scheduler. I put a red box in the time box with a "Current Time" place holder in the task box.

From 2pm-4pm those are the times that are availble to put tasks to complete inside, those times are green color coded.

# STYLE.CSS
For each column I made the boder-radis: 10px, display: flex, and text-alighn: center. I wanted the border to be solid with a padding of 5px.
This is also where I made the times that were past grey, the current time red, and the available time green.

# MAIN.JS
I made a save button for the user to save their tasks or plans to the local storage.
I also tried to make it save so when the user refreshes, their tasks will be saved.
